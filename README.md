# Scala-js-snake-with-blackjack-and-hookers
Not ended , but pretty ready project to test and improve skills with scala-js framework.
The main idea was to add fire function and multiplayer to provide more variety to the common game.  
Some features were not finished, but there are some another interesting projects, that need my care,
so I believe the idea is clear.
